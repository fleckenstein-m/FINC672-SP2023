## Course Overview

The objective of this course is to provide an overview of empirical research in finance. This course is divided into two main parts. In the first part students develop fundamental programming knowledge and data science skills in the Julia programming language. This part of the course is an intensive introduction to procedures for collecting, processing, and analyzing financial datasets which become increasingly important with the emergence and popularization of "big data" in finance. The second part of the course covers widely-used state-of-the-art statistical methodologies in empirical asset pricing. Students will learn to apply programming techniques to real-world empirical research questions in the equity markets and fixed income markets.

## Learning Goals

After completing this course, students will have a thorough understanding of fundamental programming concepts and tools in financial data science, and be able to apply these skills to real-world problems in empirical asset pricing.

## Grading Policy

Your final grade is based on i) two midterm exams, ii) a final exam, and iii) class participation. Grading is on a curve. This means that you will be ranked relative to all students in both sections based on your two midterms, the final exam, and quizzes. The weighting shown below under Final Grade Breakdown determines your final rank among all students enrolled in the sections I teach.

- 10% Class Participation/ Quizzes
- 30% Midterm 1
  - *March 8, 2022*
- 30% Midterm 2
  - *April 12, 2022*
- 30% Final Exam
  - *May 17, 2022*


# Assessment Component: Class Participation

- You are expected to come to class and be prepared to answer questions on the material. *Homework assignments* are self-graded and will not be collected. I reserve the right to give *quizzes* in class. These will not officially be announced beforehand. The in-class quizzes will be modeled on the examples in the lecture material, after the topic is covered. Quizzes are graded and count towards your Class Participation score.
